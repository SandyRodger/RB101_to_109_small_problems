document1 = "Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment often featured in discussions of the interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger devised " +
"it in 1935 as an argument against the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which states that an object in a physical system can simultaneously exist in all possible configurations, " +
"a state called quantum superposition, and only observing the system forces the object into just one of those possible states. Schrödinger disagreed with this interpretation. In particular, " +
"quantum superposition could not work with larger objects. As an illustration, he presented a scenario with a cat in a sealed box, whose fate was linked to a subatomic event that may or may not occur. " +
"In a quantum superposed state of the subatomic particles, the cat would be both alive and dead, until someone opened the box and observed it."
